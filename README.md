## About me

### Introduction

My name is Paul Zupan (they/them), and I make games for fun. I love
collaborating with my friends on different projects. I'm well versed in python,
but I know the basics of other languages like C and lua. I'm interested in
making games, playing music, and cubing, to name a few.


### My Repositories

"bossfight" is a text based boss battle created in Java. I started work on it a
while ago, and I'm not actively working on it at the moment. Maybe someday I'll
  revisit it.

"dotfiles" is my collection of configuration files for various programs that I
use a lot. It's nothing special now, but as time goes on, that repository will
likely grow the most. Feel free to use any and all configs that you find in
there.

"dwm" is my copy of suckless's Dynamic Window Manager. I've been mostly using
i3 up until this point, but I thought that maybe I'd be more open to using dwm
if I had the codebase backed up to my own git repository. Just like dotfiles,
  please feel free to use any of the code you see in this repository.


### What I'm Working On

Currently, as of December of 2021, I am a high school student who loves to
code. I'm mostly just figuring out what I want to do for a job (most likely
something involving computer science) and making some projects that I can show
on my resume.


### How You Can Reach Me

The best ways to get in contact with me are through my email or my discord. You
can email me at `paul.zupan.13@gmail.com`, which I check pretty frequently. A
better way to reach me would be to message me at `eggs#5175`. I look at discord
a few times a day to you should get a fast response.
