# About me

My name is Paul Zupan, and I make games for fun. I love collaborating with my friends on different projects. I'm well versed in C++, but I know the basics of other languages like Python and Java. I'm interested in playing games, making games, playing music, and cubing, to name a few.

# My Repositories

"bossfight" is a text based boss battle created in Java. I started work on it a while ago, and I'm not actively working on it at the moment. Maybe someday I'll revisit it.

"SDLGameFramework" is some boilerplate SDL code for a 2D video game. I decided to write it up so I'd have a place to start for all the games I make in the future. I'm relatively new to SDL so look upon my code favorably.
