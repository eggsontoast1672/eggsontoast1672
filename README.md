# About me

My name is Paul Zupan, and I make games for fun. I love collaborating with my friends on different projects. I'm well versed in C++, but I know the basics of other languages like Python and Java. I'm interested in playing games, making games, playing music, and cubing, to name a few.

You can reach me at eggs#5175 on discord.
